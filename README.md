<!-- Decision Theory -->

[toc]

# Preliminary

## Orga

* TA $\rightarrow$ 23.05., CJ $\rightarrow$ 05.06.
* We can have access to old videos (recorded Zoom lecture)
* Monday 10:05 -- 11:45
* Tuesday 17:05 -- 19:45 + break
* Timeseries may be interesting

## Learning objectives

* Learn to design and solve decision problems
* Get an outside perspective on / widen the horizons of "common statistics and machine learning"
  * Frame it into decision problems
  * Reflect on the notion of uncertainty

# Introduction

* Choose an action out of many \
  $\rightarrow$ Consequences (Utility / loss, depend on an unknown nature) \
  $\rightarrow$ Optimize
* Unknown $\rightarrow$ uncertainty (statistics yay)
  * Also data
  * And losses
* Interdisciplinary importance
  * Rational choice theory
  * Uncertainty in AI, expert systems, decision support systems
  * Decision theory

## Rational choice

* Macro-level by aggregation of individual actions
* Goal-oriented rational actor
* Game theory
* In sociology: e.g. Coleman: Foundations of Social Theory
* Modern: bounded rationality $\rightarrow$ behavioural economics (Kahneman & Tversky 1979, Nobel prize 2002)
* Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy (MCMP)

## Uncertainty in AI

* Expert systems
* Uncertainty in AI (based on name of a group)
* E.g. portfolio management
* How would an expert behave? Model that
* Make expert knowledge widely available
* Paper on autonomous driving systems (ADS)
* MYCIN $\rightarrow$ methodological consequences
